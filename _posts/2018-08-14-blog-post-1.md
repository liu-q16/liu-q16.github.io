I devote much of my extracurricular time to watching football matches and playing football games. I am a super fan of Real Madrid, a Spanish football club which attracts extraordinary football players all over the world. 

In the long history of Real Madrid, there have been so many talented and world-class players. My favorite is Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portugal legend, who has been transferred to Juventus in 2018.10. He has won so many honors and trophies and he is still so self-disciplined and shows his incessant passion in every game.
