Alongside the academic research, I devote much of my extracurricular time to watching football matches and playing football games. I am a super fan of Real Madrid. My favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo, although he was transferred to Juventus in 2018, which made me kinda heart-broken. Ronaldo had a tough childhood and faced many difficulties during his early career, but he kept going and pursued his goal and finally becomes one of the best football players in history . His toughness, persistence and passion for his career really motivate me a lot.
