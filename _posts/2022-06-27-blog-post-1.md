This has been a INSANE football year where the greatest players Messi and Ronaldo made a transfer to PSG and MU, repectively. I has been following news from different social media platforms these days and obviously Ronaldo was closed to sign Manchester City. It is actually not a good taste in my heart as I know many MU fans will be disppointed. I woke up in the morning and found that transfer of Ronaldo has been officially announced. I did not feel very excited at the first time until she told me that it was Manchster United! I'm still shocking how MU made it happen in such a few hours.

I really cannot believe CR7 will return to Manchester United after 12 years. He almost won everything in MU and then transferred to Real Madrid, and Juventus. Now the man is back home at the age of 36!!!

你在无数顶级联赛证明了自己，如今誉满归根，回到梦起始的地方。你是伯纳乌的传奇，但回到曼市，你还是那个驰骋球场的青葱少年！
