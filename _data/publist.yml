  description: In this article, we develop a general framework CausalEGM for estimating causal effects by encoding generative modeling, which can be applied in both binary and continuous treatment settings. We establish a bidirectional transformation between the high-dimensional confounders space and a low-dimensional latent space where the density is known. Through this, CausalEGM simultaneously decouples the dependencies of confounders on both treatment and outcome and maps the confounders to the low-dimensional latent space. By conditioning on the low-dimensional latent features, CausalEGM can estimate the causal effect for each individual or the average causal effect within a population. Our theoretical analysis shows that the excess risk for CausalEGM can be bounded through empirical process theory. Under an assumption on encoder-decoder networks, the consistency of the estimate can be guaranteed.

- title: "Density estimation using deep generative neural networks"

  description: We introduce a new general-purpose density estimator based on deep generative neural networks. By modeling data normally distributed around a manifold of reduced dimension, we show how the power of bidirectional generative neural networks (e.g., cycleGAN) can be exploited for explicit evaluation of the data density.
