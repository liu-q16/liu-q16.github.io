- title: "HiChIPdb: a comprehensive database of HiChIP regulatory interactions"
  image: HiChIPdb.jpg
  description: To facilitate the studies of 3D regulatory interactions, we developed a HiChIP interactions database, HiChIPdb (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/hichipdb/). The current version of HiChIPdb contains around 262M annotated HiChIP interactions from 200 high-throughput HiChIP samples across 108 cell types. We believe this database has the potential to remove the barrier in HiChIP data aggregation, preprocessing, and analysis.

- title: "Density estimation using deep generative neural networks"
  image: Roundtrip.jpg
  description: We introduce a new general-purpose density estimator based on deep generative neural networks. By modeling data normally distributed around a manifold of reduced dimension, we show how the power of bidirectional generative neural networks (e.g., cycleGAN) can be exploited for explicit evaluation of the data density.

  image: scDEC.png
  description: We proposed scDEC, a computational tool for single cell data analysis with deep generative neural networks. scDEC is built on a pair of generative adversarial networks (GANs), and is capable of learning the latent representation and inferring the cell labels, simultaneously. scDEC can be used for clustering scATAC-seq and Multiome data.

- title: "Cancer drug response prediction via a hybrid graph convolutional network"
  image: DeepCDR.png
  description:  DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a uniform graph convolutional network (UGCN) and multiple subnetworks. Unlike prior studies modeling hand-crafted features of drugs, DeepCDR automatically learns the latent representation of topological structures among atoms and bonds of drugs. DeepCDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in cancer drug response prediction.
