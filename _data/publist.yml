- title: "Density estimation using deep generative neural networks"
  image: Roundtrip.jpg
  description: We introduce a new general-purpose density estimator based on deep generative neural networks. By modeling data normally distributed around a manifold of reduced dimension, we show how the power of bidirectional generative neural networks (e.g., cycleGAN) can be exploited for explicit evaluation of the data density.

- title: "Simultaneous deep generative modeling and clustering of single-cell genomic data"
  image: scDEC.png
  description: We proposed scDEC, a computational tool for single cell data analysis with deep generative neural networks. scDEC is built on a pair of generative adversarial networks (GANs), and is capable of learning the latent representation and inferring the cell labels, simultaneously.

  image: DeepCDR.png
  description:  DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a uniform graph convolutional network (UGCN) and multiple subnetworks. Unlike prior studies modeling hand-crafted features of drugs, DeepCDR automatically learns the latent representation of topological structures among atoms and bonds of drugs.

- title: "hicGAN Infers Super Resolution Hi-C Data with Generative Adversarial Networks"
  image: hicGAN.png
  description: We proposed hicGAN for inferring high resolution Hi-C data from low resolution Hi-C data with generative adversarial networks (GANs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply GANs to 3D genome analysis.
