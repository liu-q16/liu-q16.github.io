- title: "Density estimation using deep generative neural networks"
  image: Roundtrip.jpg
  description: We introduce a new general-purpose density estimator based on deep generative neural networks. By modeling data normally distributed around a manifold of reduced dimension, we show how the power of bidirectional generative neural networks (e.g., cycleGAN) can be exploited for explicit evaluation of the data density.
