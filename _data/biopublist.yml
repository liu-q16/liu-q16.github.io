- title: "Simultaneous deep generative modeling and clustering of single-cell genomic data"
  image: scDEC.png
  description: We proposed scDEC, a computational tool for single cell data analysis with deep generative neural networks. scDEC is built on a pair of generative adversarial networks (GANs), and is capable of learning the latent representation and inferring the cell labels, simultaneously. scDEC can be used for clustering scATAC-seq and Multiome data.

  description: We proposed hicGAN for inferring high resolution Hi-C data from low resolution Hi-C data with generative adversarial networks (GANs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply GANs to 3D genome analysis. Pretrained hicGAN models were also provided.

- title: "Cancer drug response prediction via a hybrid graph convolutional network"
  image: DeepCDR.png
  description:  DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a uniform graph convolutional network (UGCN) and multiple subnetworks. Unlike prior studies modeling hand-crafted features of drugs, DeepCDR automatically learns the latent representation of topological structures among atoms and bonds of drugs. DeepCDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in cancer drug response prediction.
