I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Automation](http://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.stanford.edu/). My research interests lie in various problems in Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology. In particular, I am interested in developing machine learning algorithms for interpreting NGS data and biomedical data.
